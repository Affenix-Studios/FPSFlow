# Changelog
---

## [1.5.1]

### Fixed
- **Server-forced nameplate visibility** — nameplate culling now respects when a server forces nametag visibility via game rules or plugins
  - Added detection for `showDeathMessages` and nameplate override packets
  - Nameplate culling gracefully backs off when the server mandates visibility, avoiding visual conflicts
  - Prevents nametag flickering caused by client/server visibility disagreement

### Changed
- Nameplate culling is now more robust in multiplayer scenarios with varied server configurations
- Server-side nameplate settings are now honored alongside client-side distance culling
- Entity LOD distances are now configurable, so medium/far render skip thresholds can be tuned per profile or saved custom profile
- Default Balanced Entity LOD distances widened to 40 / 80 blocks for smoother distant entity rendering

---

## [1.5.0]

### Fixed
- **Preserve player rendering in PvP views** — other players are no longer subject to entity LOD throttling, so F5 and multiplayer combat remain crisp.
- **Avoid duplicate async occlusion checks** — the entity culling queue now deduplicates requests and limits backlog growth, reducing spikey workload when many entities are near the visibility threshold.
- **Faster entity-type override lookups** — entity type override checks are cached to avoid repeated string allocations during render traversal.

### Added
- **Low-FPS adaptive culling** — entity and block entity culling distances are reduced automatically when FPS drops, so busy scenes become smoother.

### Changed
- `mod_version` bumped to `1.5.0`.

### Notes
- These changes target intermittent hangs and render stalls, especially during view changes and busy entity scenes.

## [1.4.0]

### Added
- **Custom profiles** — create your own performance presets and switch between built-in and saved custom profiles using the in-game profile button.
- **Profile persistence** — selected custom profiles now load automatically at startup.
- **Custom profile management** — both built-in and saved profile state are preserved across sessions.

### Changed
- **Config workflow improved** — profile selection and custom preset behavior now work more reliably in the in-game config screen.

## [1.3.1]


### Fixed
- **Nameplate flicker at distance** – name tags no longer rapidly blink on/off when an entity hovers near the culling threshold
  - Visibility decisions are now cached per entity and re-evaluated only every N ticks (`checkIntervalTicks`, default 5)
  - A 15 % hysteresis dead-band is applied around `maxDistance`: a visible tag only disappears when the entity moves clearly *beyond* the threshold, and a hidden tag only reappears when the entity moves clearly *inside* it
  - Combined effect: smooth transitions with no per-frame toggling

### Changed
- `nameplateCulling` config section gains a new field `checkIntervalTicks` (default `5`)
  - Balanced: 6 ticks, Performance: 4 ticks, Ultra Performance: 3 ticks
  - Existing configs without this field default to 5 ticks automatically

---

## [1.3.0]

### Added
- **Entity LOD (Level of Detail)** – distant entities are render-throttled to reduce GPU load without culling them entirely
  - Medium LOD (>32 b on Balanced): entity renders every 2nd tick
  - Far LOD (>64 b on Balanced): entity renders every 3rd tick
  - XOR-based distribution ensures throttling is staggered across entities (no mass-freeze on a single tick)
  - Configurable distances per profile; toggle in the in-game config screen
- **Nameplate Culling** – entity name tags are hidden beyond a configurable distance (default 32 b on Balanced)
  - Applies to all entities, including players, mobs, and armor stands
  - Toggle in the in-game config screen
- **Map Item Frame Throttle** – item frames displaying maps update their render state only every N ticks instead of every frame
  - Default: every 3–5 ticks depending on profile (every frame on Quality)
  - Initial render always runs; throttle kicks in after the first map texture is loaded
  - Toggle in the in-game config screen
- **HUD dirty-flag feedback loop** – the HUD throttle now force-enables itself for one tick whenever a player stat actually changes (health, food, armor, XP, air)
  - Previously the throttle ran purely on tick parity; now it always catches real changes immediately
  - Net effect: no more delayed health/hunger display when hit or eating

### Changed
- Performance profiles updated with values for all three new features
- Quality profile: Entity LOD enabled with generous distances; Nameplate Culling and Map Frame Throttle disabled
- Balanced/Performance/Ultra Performance: all three features enabled with progressively tighter settings

---

## [1.2.0]

### Added
- **World Join Optimizer** – detects when the player joins a world (singleplayer or multiplayer) and temporarily tightens entity, block-entity, and particle culling distances for a configurable grace period
  - Starts at 35% of normal cull distances and eases linearly back to 100% over the grace period
  - Async occlusion raycast batch increases 3× during grace period to drain the backlog faster
  - Grace period: 200 ticks (10 s) on Quality/Balanced, 160 t (8 s) on Performance, 120 t (6 s) on Ultra Performance
  - Toggle in the in-game config screen under "Join Optimizer"
- `worldJoinOptimizer` section added to `fpsflow.json` with `enabled` and `gracePeriodTicks` fields

---

## [1.1.0]

### Added
- **Block Entity Culling** – skips rendering distant block entities (chests, furnaces, signs, banners, item frames, armor stands); configurable max distance per profile
- **In-game Config Screen** – accessible via ModMenu; toggle all features and cycle between profiles without editing JSON
- **ModMenu Integration** – when ModMenu is installed, FPSFlow appears in the mod list with a settings button
- **Async Occlusion Culling** – occlusion raycasts are now spread across multiple game ticks (up to 8 per tick) to eliminate frame spikes when many entities need rechecking simultaneously
- **Per-Entity-Type Overrides** – add entries to `entityCulling.entityTypeOverrides` in `fpsflow.json` to always-cull or never-cull specific entity types (e.g. `{"minecraft:armor_stand": false}`)

### Changed
- Performance profiles now also configure block entity culling distance
- `asyncOcclusion` field added to `entityCulling` config section (default: `true`)
- `blockEntityCulling` section added to config with `enabled` and `maxDistance` fields

### Notes
- ModMenu is optional — the mod works without it; the config screen is simply unavailable
- Block entity culling is distance-only (no occlusion raycast); occlusion on block entities is planned for a future release

---

## [1.0.0]

### Added
- **Entity Culling** with frustum, occlusion (raycast-based), and distance culling
- **Particle Optimization** – count cap and distance-based spawn filtering
- **Adaptive Renderer** – FPS-aware dynamic culling level adjustments
- **GUI Optimizer** – hotbar slot dirty-flag tracking, HUD update throttling
- **Smart Render Scheduler** – smoothed FPS monitoring via exponential moving average
- **Performance Profiles** – Quality, Balanced, Performance, Ultra Performance presets
- **Compatibility detection** for EntityCulling, Sodium, ImmediatelyFast, Lithium, FerriteCore, ModernFix
- **Modrinth Update Checker** – async check on startup, in-game chat notification
- **Localisation** – English (en_us) and German (de_de) included
- JSON-based configuration at `config/fpsflow.json`

### Notes
- Entity occlusion culling is disabled automatically when the EntityCulling mod is detected
- HUD caching is disabled automatically when ImmediatelyFast is detected
- The adaptive renderer temporarily tightens particle and entity culling when FPS falls below 30 or 15
